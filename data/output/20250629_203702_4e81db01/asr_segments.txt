0.00	5.80	 Years ago, a mentor told me that the most important part of any story is surprise.
5.80	9.64	 A few years later, a writer I deeply respect, wrote that perhaps the difference would
9.64	14.56	 put in good and great writing is technique, though even that was probably not as important
14.56	15.56	 as conviction.
15.56	20.06	 But what keeps us invested in the story is curiosity, the gap between what we know and what
20.06	23.16	 we need to know, the questions that drive us.
23.16	26.76	 Combine all three and you tend to create something special.
26.76	29.76	 Which and every one of us has played a game that grabbed us from the jump that
29.76	35.04	 connected with us in some unexpected way, a game that surprised us, whose belief in itself
35.04	39.00	 was obvious from the first frame that made us want to explore.
39.00	43.68	 I have played a lot of video games friends and that feeling is increasingly rare for me,
43.68	45.28	 especially in the AAA space.
45.28	49.88	 So when I tell you that Clare Obscure, Expedition 33, grabbed me by the throat from the
49.88	55.92	 jump and didn't let go for a single second of the three and a half hour demo I played twice,
56.92	59.52	 I believe me when I tell you that's some powerful magic.
59.52	66.48	 Expedition is, we do not take for granted that you dedicate your final year of life to
66.48	69.24	 keeping hope alive for all of Lumia.
69.24	73.68	 If you're unfamiliar, Clare Obscure Expedition 33 has a pretty fascinating setup.
73.68	77.68	 See there's this being called the Pinterest and every year she paints a new number.
77.68	83.36	 When she does, every person of that age dies, poof, vanishes, turns to dust, do not pass
83.44	85.76	 go, do not collect $200.
85.76	90.24	 And the thing is she's counting down, every year the people die and get younger.
90.24	95.08	 So every year the people of Lumiares and volunteer expedition of people with one year left
95.08	100.64	 to live on a desperate impossible doomed mission to go to the continent across the sea
100.64	103.76	 and kill the Pinterest so she can never paint death again.
103.76	105.76	 You battle the Pinterest.
105.76	108.60	 Now that Lumia fights with you.
108.60	112.76	 You'll find journals from Expedition 84 so if you can do the math in your head, you'll
112.76	118.12	 get how desperate this whole thing is and how young but still older than the average RPG protagonist,
118.12	119.52	 your characters are.
119.52	122.76	 And from the ones who came before.
122.76	125.84	 And they betray them, for the ones who come after.
125.84	128.88	 Things get weirder once your crew lands on the continent.
128.88	133.00	 They almost immediately run into an old man who nearly dispatches the whole expedition single
133.00	138.00	 handedly.
138.00	142.16	 You play as Gustav, one of the survivors, traumatized in a lone, walking through countless
142.16	145.12	 corpses from other expeditions and his own.
145.12	148.76	 He's about to shoot himself and he's found by Lumia and other member of the expedition.
148.76	151.12	 You do that.
151.12	152.12	 He both die.
152.12	156.56	 She's not blind to reality, they're probably both going to die, but expedition number
156.56	157.56	 swear on oath.
157.56	159.64	 When one falls, we continue.
159.64	162.40	 As long as one of them stands, their fight isn't over.
162.40	166.48	 Lumia and Gustav clearly care about one another but they don't always get along.
166.48	171.36	 When they find an unsigned message indicating another member of Expedition 33, Mayel, might
171.36	172.36	 still be alive.
172.36	176.80	 Gustav wants to drop everything and try to save her and then get out of dodge.
176.80	179.40	 Lumia is worried that the whole thing is a trap.
179.40	182.32	 Expedition members are always supposed to sign their messages.
182.32	183.32	 We have to go.
183.32	184.32	 No.
184.32	185.32	 Not yet.
185.32	190.20	 At one point later on, Lumia asks Gustav if he's a coward because he just wants to get
190.20	191.68	 me out and get out.
191.68	192.68	 He's not.
192.68	196.00	 He's just dealing with watching almost everyone he knows die.
196.00	200.12	 And Lumia, she's the one that's supposed to land on that beach in the first place.
200.12	201.68	 Either one of them has it easy.
201.68	204.20	 These characters are adults and they're written like it.
204.20	206.72	 Come on, we always set the future of Lumia.
206.72	209.92	 It's more important than any individual lives.
209.92	212.36	 They don't always agree.
212.36	216.32	 They're dealing with guilt and loss and trauma and they're not always kind to one another
216.32	217.88	 in the heat of the moment.
217.88	222.44	 But they care about each other and at the end of that exchange, once they've calm down,
222.44	224.44	 they share a laugh.
224.68	225.44	 The mission.
227.84	229.84	 Really?
229.84	232.28	 Compiling characters are complex and flawed.
232.28	235.32	 And Expedition 33 seems to understand that.
235.32	235.84	 Sorry.
239.44	243.68	 Even if they weren't, Expedition 33 could probably skate by on the world.
243.68	245.32	 My demo was fairly linear.
245.32	249.48	 They were branching paths with hidden grapple points, platforming, goodies, and secrets
249.48	252.28	 to find and tough optional bosses to take on.
252.28	255.96	 But this isn't an open world game and it's better for it.
255.96	259.08	 Expedition 33 reminds me of Final Fantasy X.
259.08	262.32	 These environments may be linear, but they're gorgeous, whether you're standing at
262.32	267.28	 top of hill looking at the Indigo tree or both underwater and somehow not.
267.28	269.64	 Expedition 33 is a visual feast.
269.64	275.04	 And I stopped in every environment I entered to marvel at the beauty and composition on display.
275.04	280.04	 There's even a world map universe to get from place to place, like the RPGs of old.
280.04	281.04	 This'll be useful.
281.04	283.52	 It really hooked me however was the combat.
283.52	287.08	 Clare obscure may be turn-based, but it's not a DVD menu.
287.08	289.52	 There's a lot of depth here.
289.52	294.64	 Every character has a melee and ranged attack, the latter of which must be aimed manually.
294.64	298.12	 melee attacks build AP and ranged attacks spend it.
298.12	302.80	 You'll also need AP for skills, meac attacks that each character has in their arsenal.
302.80	306.24	 And on top of that each character has a particular attribute.
306.24	310.12	 Gustav can use certain skills to build up stacks of overcharge, which he can spend to
310.12	312.36	 cash out for devastating attack.
312.36	316.96	 Moon A spells grant elemental stains that can supercharge her other spells for additional
316.96	317.96	 effects and damage.
317.96	321.00	 In my favorite, male, you do rescue her.
321.00	322.00	 This isn't a spoiler.
322.00	324.40	 She's in Clare Obscure's trailers.
324.40	329.56	 Conswitch between three different stances offering buffs to attack, AP generation and defense.
329.56	333.68	 Managing your AP, setting up a big combo and planning ahead matters.
333.68	337.96	 Like FF10, the turn order is displayed on the left side of the screen, so you can plan
337.96	339.56	 every turn in advance.
339.56	343.56	 But strategy is only half the battle.
343.56	346.00	 The other half is moment to moment execution.
346.00	349.80	 You don't just choose an option and wait for a canned animation to play out.
349.80	353.96	 When an enemy attacks you, you can dodge, peri, or jump to avoid it.
353.96	358.52	 Daging avoids attacks while perying nets to a potentially huge counterattack and awards
358.52	361.80	 AP, but has a tighter window.
361.80	365.32	 Sometimes the only way out is to jump over something.
365.32	369.48	 Sure, you can engage in the time-on-a-duty addition of blocking with your face, but the
369.48	373.40	 harder fights are going to force you to engage with these defensive mechanics.
373.40	377.40	 And if you parry an attack that hits your whole squad, all of them strike back in a beautifully
377.40	381.76	 choreographed counterattack that never gets old.
381.76	386.40	 Early on, I ran into a very powerful enemy who could kill my characters in a single hit.
386.40	389.32	 But the thing was, he had to hit me.
389.32	391.12	 If I could parry him, I could win.
391.12	393.28	 It took me a couple tries on my first run.
393.28	398.32	 He had a tricky attack that forced me to parry or dodge twice in a row, but once I figured
398.32	408.64	 out I could parry the first hit and dodge the second, I managed to take him down.
408.64	411.52	 Then there's the back end stuff called Pickedos and Luminas.
411.52	416.08	 You can equip up to three Pickedos to any character, which provides buffs, like shooting
416.08	420.48	 this enemy might light them on fire or attacks to more damage, or killing an enemy
420.48	423.76	 Grants more AP, as well as Stadup Braids.
423.76	428.12	 Win enough battles with a Pickedo equipped, and you can have everyone else equip its effects,
428.12	429.92	 minus the Stadbullis.
429.92	433.04	 And this is where you can do some really degenerate stuff.
433.04	438.72	 Sure, Mail has a skill that puts her in virtualostan, which she does 200% damage.
438.72	441.28	 If she uses it while an enemy is burning.
441.28	445.12	 Normally, you'd have to have somebody using another skill to set this up.
445.12	449.32	 But what if you gave Gustav and Lune a Luminas that means their ranged attacks are likely
449.32	454.52	 to set enemies on fire?
454.52	457.96	 Or maybe you equipped with Pickedo that cranks up your base attack damage or it rewards
457.96	462.28	 more AP for nailing a parry, allowing you to stay on the offensive longer than you
462.28	463.88	 normally be able to.
463.88	467.48	 Then you're equipped with gas.
467.48	470.96	 Combine all of that in battles offer a lot of interesting choices.
470.96	475.72	 If someone's low on health, you spend an item or AP to bring them back up, or you bet
475.72	478.76	 it all on dodging or parrying the next attack.
478.76	483.04	 How do you level up your characters who gets what skill is a Pickedo so they can stack
483.04	487.80	 their right stats and they don't have to spend Lune a point to get that effect and on and
487.80	489.12	 on it goes.
489.12	494.28	 And through it all, Expedition 33 is constantly finding new ways to make it self-interesting.
494.28	498.48	 What's a gestural and why is Lune obsessed with them?
498.48	501.36	 Who is the Pantris and what does she want?
501.36	503.36	 Why is the world the way that it is?
503.36	505.36	 Are all these beings actually hostile?
505.36	509.60	 What they've seen pretty friendly and you have the option to fight them or leave them alone?
509.60	511.20	 Was it you with that old man?
511.20	513.08	 How does any of this stuff work?
513.08	518.08	 In my demo, Clare Obscure Expedition 33 didn't stop to explain itself and I appreciated
518.08	519.08	 that.
519.08	523.52	 It trusted me to figure things out and I was more invested in what was going on as a result.
523.52	526.36	 Most importantly, I could never predict what would happen next.
526.36	530.56	 By the time thank you for playing, came up on my screen at the end of my demo, I was
530.56	534.32	 thoroughly hooked.
534.32	538.72	 And my second run through, I found even more hidden areas and laid the smack down one
538.72	545.08	 of the optional fights that had form mixed me the first time around.
545.08	549.32	 With my time with Clare Obscure Expedition 33 was up, I wasn't ready to stop.
549.32	553.00	 I wanted to fight more battles, learn more about the world and spend more time with these
553.00	554.00	 characters.
554.00	558.40	 Sanfall Interactive is a new studio but you never know this was the first game from playing
558.40	559.40	 it.
559.40	562.76	 Surprise, Conviction, Curiosity.
562.76	566.12	 Share Obscure Expedition 33 nails all three.
566.12	568.56	 It had my interest before I played it.
568.56	570.80	 Now it has my undivided attention.
570.80	574.96	 If Sanfall can stick the landing, that will put together something remarkable.
